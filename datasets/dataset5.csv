don't work yet.  I have a TODO list a light-year long.  I expect many
of my problems would go away if we had the resources to dedicate a CPU
server (to run daemons) and a file server.

I'm interested in hearing how others are doing...

down a bit.  (There are 75 people on the list right now.)

One person has suggested that the name of the list be changed to
9fans.  There's already an alias for that, in any event.

The list is not being archived (that I know of).  If someone wants to
do it, that would be great.

This is in the 8.5 manual page.  To stop and resume text output: put
the window into non-scroll mode and use the page-down/VIEW key (again
check the manual pages like 8.5 and keyboard(6)), its altgraph on some
keyboard and the arrow keys on others.  This will scroll half a page.

The connection to the file server is not cached, so
there is no need to sync.

The equivalent of ^C is delete.  (Long ago, Delete was
the standard interrupt character on Unix too, but
Berkeley, in their infinite wisdom, decided to switch
to ^C.)

The equivalent of ^S and ^Q is the scroll/noscroll
item on the middle mouse button menu, together with
the scrollbar.

sometimes it's non-trivial to re-invent _every_ wheel
before using it, however nice it might be... :-)

IMHO, one of the nice things about plan 9 is how easily
most `naive' unix programs port to it.
